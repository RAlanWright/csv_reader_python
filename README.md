# csv_reader_python is an altered version of a program I already threw together.  

This version is isolating specific details related to a csv file for testing purposes.

Those details are taken, counted, and output into a separate file for whichever csv is passed into the code.

Future iterations will include command line functionality (ex: piping a csv file into the program from the command line when running it).
